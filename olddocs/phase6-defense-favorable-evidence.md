# Phase 6: Defense Favorable Evidence Report
## United States v. Creeden (Case 2:24-cr-20070-DDC-TJJ)
## Evidence Supporting Defense

**Generated:** 2026-02-05
**Agent:** Phase 6 Defense Evidence Mining
**Prior Reports:** phase1-5 (Newman, Nitcher, Brown/Stapp analysis)

---

## Executive Summary

This Phase 6 report documents evidence FAVORABLE TO THE DEFENSE mined from the complete case database. The evidence supports multiple defense themes including: (1) authorization existed through dual approval systems, (2) good faith reliance on superiors and established practices, (3) absence of written IEC policy, (4) standard industry practice, and (5) legitimate business purpose assumptions.

**KEY FINDING:** Multiple witnesses, including government witnesses and cooperators, provide testimony that supports defense arguments. The Blake & Uhlig legal memos establish that the IBB Constitution provides "fairly broad authorization" and courts extend deference to union constitutional interpretations using a "reasonableness standard."

## Defense Theme 1: Dual Approval System Existed

### Evidence Found

| Evidence | Source Document | Verbatim Quote | Provenance Hash | Confidence |
|----------|-----------------|----------------|-----------------|------------|
| Dual approval required for expenses | Bathory Grand Jury Transcript | "there were supposed to be dual approvals on expenses from both the president and the secretary-treasurer" | sha256:c125e3f0ef03e491bb410b5fee29a006a74352999029b71f43a46b41322a6a8f | HIGH |
| Approval process confirmed | Bathory Grand Jury Transcript | "So once you had dual approvals as well as that audit, then it could come to the accounting department for payments via check" | sha256:c125e3f0ef03e491bb410b5fee29a006a74352999029b71f43a46b41322a6a8f | HIGH |
| President's side and IST side both approved | Bathory Grand Jury Transcript | "approved by the president's side... then it would come to the secretary-treasurer's side where Kathy Stapp... would sign off on it for the international secretary-treasurer side" | sha256:c125e3f0ef03e491bb410b5fee29a006a74352999029b71f43a46b41322a6a8f | HIGH |

### Analysis
Ashley Bathory, the IBB Accounting Supervisor who testified before the Grand Jury, confirmed that a DUAL APPROVAL SYSTEM existed. Expenses required approval from BOTH the President's side (Tracy Buck, Tyler Brown) AND the Secretary-Treasurer's side (Kathy Stapp, Susie Skinner). This internal control system demonstrates that Creeden was not acting unilaterally - expenses went through multiple layers of review before payment.

**Defense Argument:** If expenses were embezzled or unauthorized, the dual approval system should have caught them. The fact that expenses were paid means they received proper institutional approval through established channels.

## Defense Theme 2: Good Faith Reliance / Assumption of Legitimacy

### Evidence Found

| Evidence | Source | Verbatim Quote | Provenance Hash | Confidence |
|----------|--------|----------------|-----------------|------------|
| Nitcher assumed expenses were legitimate | FBI 302 (2024-01-10) | "NITCHER assumed all expenses made by JONES, BILL, and IVPs were for the benefit of the union" | sha256:2ba525d7f23e6be4070ce64ee533f98ad0087a336c0442bce78c01443765bfca | HIGH |
| Bathory assumed meeting expenses legitimate | FBI 302 (2024-02-24) | "BATHORY explained an expense labeled 'meeting' was assumed to be a legitimate business expense" | sha256:0fc62274691fe33d9970945784d27d0ee02a3a0d962f450a3f17e321a601062a | HIGH |
| Bathory assumed Jones working for IBB | FBI 302 (2024-02-24) | "When BATHORY saw JONES' expenses she did not question them because JONES was always travelling, and she assumed he was working for IBB" | sha256:0fc62274691fe33d9970945784d27d0ee02a3a0d962f450a3f17e321a601062a | HIGH |
| IBB operated under assumption | Stapp Proffer | "STAPP said IBB operated under the assumption that if JONES said it was a business expense, it was a business expense" | sha256:ce8937c0d4de448b1d7cc9db5333af2a4f9d761855ac905452fd2033e8a3a40a | HIGH |
| Jones knows the rules | Stapp Proffer | "STAPP said, 'He's (JONES) the IP, he knows the rules'" | sha256:ce8937c0d4de448b1d7cc9db5333af2a4f9d761855ac905452fd2033e8a3a40a | HIGH |

### Analysis
Multiple witnesses - including the government's cooperating witness Kathy Stapp - confirm that the entire organization operated on a GOOD FAITH ASSUMPTION that executive expenses were legitimate. This creates a defense of reliance on established organizational norms.

**Defense Argument:** If trained accounting professionals assumed expenses were legitimate, how can the government prove Creeden had criminal intent? The organizational culture was one of trust in executive decisions, not criminal conspiracy.

## Defense Theme 3: No Written IEC Policy Existed

### Evidence Found

| Evidence | Source | Verbatim Quote | Provenance Hash | Confidence |
|----------|--------|----------------|-----------------|------------|
| IEC had no written policy | Nitcher FBI 302 (2024-01-10) | "the International Executive Council (IEC; comprised of IP, IST, IVPs) had no written policy, but were held to the IBB Constitution and Labor Standards/Rules for expenditure of IBB funds" | sha256:2ba525d7f23e6be4070ce64ee533f98ad0087a336c0442bce78c01443765bfca | HIGH |
| No analogous policy for International | Newman Grand Jury | Q: "Is there analogous policy for the International people like this Local one?" A: "No." | sha256:13e250ab0a34a58ea98753b3278b3c9e96143db9f60077d43784aa8d0e51f513 | HIGH |
| IBB had not enacted comprehensive rules | Blake & Uhlig Memo | "To date though, IBB has not exercised its authority to enact a comprehensive set of rules governing reimbursement of reasonable and legitimate business purpose expenses" | sha256:5fcfd3e2cf5ea59f85a49bc298bd43c11d44e509b021a556a78c8ac08bbb2515 | HIGH |

### Analysis
This is CRITICAL DEFENSE EVIDENCE. The government's own witness (Newman) and the defense-side auditor (Nitcher) both confirm that the IEC had NO WRITTEN EXPENSE POLICY. Unlike Local lodges which had detailed policy handbooks, the International officers were only bound by the Constitution and general Labor Standards.

**Defense Argument:** You cannot convict someone of violating rules that don't exist. The absence of written policy means conduct must be evaluated against the broad constitutional authority, not non-existent specific rules. This creates reasonable doubt about criminal intent.

## Defense Theme 4: Constitutional Authority Was Broad

### Evidence Found

| Evidence | Source | Verbatim Quote | Provenance Hash | Confidence |
|----------|--------|----------------|-----------------|------------|
| Broad constitutional authority | Blake & Uhlig Memo | "The IBB Constitution Provides Fairly Broad Authorization Regarding Salaries And Expenses... the President and Executive Council likely have very broad authority to make determinations about reasonable salaries, benefits, and legitimate expenses" | sha256:5fcfd3e2cf5ea59f85a49bc298bd43c11d44e509b021a556a78c8ac08bbb2515 | HIGH |
| Article 5.2 authority | Blake & Uhlig Memo | "the Executive Council has the power to supervise the IBB's business and financial affairs and authorize expenditures necessary to benefit the IBB or to achieve its objectives in Article 5.2" | sha256:5fcfd3e2cf5ea59f85a49bc298bd43c11d44e509b021a556a78c8ac08bbb2515 | HIGH |
| No language constricting expenditures | Blake & Uhlig Memo | "As there is no language constricting what types of expenditures are considered to be necessary, this language provides latitude with regard to interpreting what is considered necessary or beneficial to the IBB" | sha256:5fcfd3e2cf5ea59f85a49bc298bd43c11d44e509b021a556a78c8ac08bbb2515 | HIGH |
| Court deference to unions | Blake & Uhlig Memo | "Courts will refrain from interfering with union affairs and permit union decisions based on their own constitutional interpretation to stand, barring some sort of showing of unreasonableness" | sha256:5fcfd3e2cf5ea59f85a49bc298bd43c11d44e509b021a556a78c8ac08bbb2515 | HIGH |

### Key Legal Authority Cited
- **Noble v. Sombrotto**, 525 F.3d 1230 (D.C. Cir. 2008) - Courts recognized unions must have ability to offer competitive compensation "for the benefit of the union as a whole"
- **Morrissey v. Curran**, 650 F.2d 1267 (2d Cir. 1981) - "minimum interference in the internal affairs of unions"

### Analysis
The IBB's own legal counsel (Blake & Uhlig) provided memoranda stating that the Constitution grants BROAD authority for executive compensation and expenses. The Executive Council could "authorize all expenditures deemed necessary" under Article 5.2.

**Defense Argument:** The Constitution authorized the Executive Council to determine what expenditures were necessary. Creeden, as IST and member of the Executive Council, was acting within this constitutional authority.

---

## Defense Theme 5: Standard Practice / Historical Conduct

### Evidence Found

| Evidence | Source | Verbatim Quote | Provenance Hash | Confidence |
|----------|--------|----------------|-----------------|------------|
| AMEX payment was standard practice | Stapp Proffer | "Standard practice was for the IBB to pay all AMEX bills immediately to avoid late penalties" | sha256:ce8937c0d4de448b1d7cc9db5333af2a4f9d761855ac905452fd2033e8a3a40a | HIGH |
| Bathory trained to standard practices | Bathory FBI 302 | "BATHORY believed she was trained well by JAGER to the standard practices of the accounting department" | sha256:0fc62274691fe33d9970945784d27d0ee02a3a0d962f450a3f17e321a601062a | HIGH |
| IVP expense protocol consistent | Stadnick Interview | "he kept doing the same protocol regarding expenses when he served as an IVP" | sha256:b86e420d54984641cf6855af68850129ce8793a35d83e1283dceab93af81eaaa | HIGH |
| Legitimate expense training | Stadnick Interview | "was trained on the dos and don'ts of legitimate expenses. He said the general rule was let your conscience be your guide" | sha256:b86e420d54984641cf6855af68850129ce8793a35d83e1283dceab93af81eaaa | HIGH |
| Manager markup standard | Slaggie FBI 302 | "It was standard practice for KYLE, as project manager, to make money on top of SAI's rate" | sha256:ea214e0e7679e44b39e7b2d934d21cc4046a153972049c7188a7d70020d0a05f | MEDIUM |

### Analysis
Multiple witnesses confirm that expense handling followed STANDARD PRACTICE that had been in place for years. Arnie Stadnick (current IP) testified he was "trained on the dos and don'ts" and continued the same protocols.

**Defense Argument:** Creeden followed the same practices that had been used for decades. He did not invent new schemes - he followed established organizational norms that everyone understood and accepted.

## Defense Theme 6: Witness Credibility Supporting Defense

### Carolyn Nitcher - "Good as Gold"

| Evidence | Source | Verbatim Quote | Provenance Hash | Confidence |
|----------|--------|----------------|-----------------|------------|
| Character endorsement | Cain FBI 302 | "CAIN describes Carolyn Nitcher (NITCHER) as 'good as gold'" | sha256:add0ea390e5a4009dca5e91a1b1ce1f14dc1a3cc072e8994c196c3e9ea4ae53b | HIGH |
| Not a Jones loyalist | Nitcher FBI 302 | "NITCHER commented, 'JONES needs to go.'" | sha256:5f6fb58e4dc012c256ce3867b2fe2e24d1097b8a122154cd0d6c0d2524142c5d | HIGH |
| 17 years of service | Nitcher FBI 302 | Employment 2006-2023 (17 years), Manager of Auditing Department | sha256:2ba525d7f23e6be4070ce64ee533f98ad0087a336c0442bce78c01443765bfca | HIGH |

### Analysis
Nitcher is a CRITICAL DEFENSE WITNESS because: (1) she has impeccable character ("good as gold"), (2) she is NOT a Newton Jones loyalist (she said "JONES needs to go"), (3) she has 17 years of institutional knowledge, and (4) her testimony supports defense themes (dual approval, no written policy, assumption of legitimacy).

## Newman Vulnerabilities (Cross-Reference from Phase 3)

Newman's grand jury testimony includes admissions that SUPPORT the defense:

1. **No written IEC policy** - He admitted under oath there was no analogous policy for International like Locals have
2. **"I'm not an expert"** - He admitted lack of expertise
3. **Never seen travel policy like this** - Shows lack of benchmark knowledge
4. **General ledger "hard to decipher"** - Challenges accuracy of his calculations

## Recommendations for Defense Strategy

### Immediate Actions
1. **Subpoena Blake & Uhlig memos** - These establish the legal framework that authorized IEC discretion
2. **Prepare Nitcher for trial** - She is the ideal defense witness (credible, not a Jones loyalist, supports key themes)
3. **Challenge Newman's expertise** - Object to any opinion testimony; demand Daubert hearing
4. **Focus on dual approval** - Multiple witnesses confirm this existed

### Trial Themes
1. **No crime without a rule** - Absence of written policy = no clear violation
2. **Good faith reliance** - Entire organization assumed legitimacy
3. **Constitutional authority** - IEC had broad discretion under Article 5.2
4. **Standard practice** - Everyone followed the same protocols
5. **Jones was in control** - Nitcher says "JONES needs to go" - she's not protecting anyone
