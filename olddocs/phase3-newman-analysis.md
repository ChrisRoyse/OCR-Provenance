## Executive Summary

Jeremy Newman, DOL Senior Investigator, serves as the government's primary quasi-expert witness on financial matters. Despite testifying extensively about LMRDA violations, embezzlement calculations, and financial analysis, **Newman has NO formal Rule 702 expert qualifications**. His testimony spans **606 pages across three grand jury appearances** (January 11, February 8, and April 3, 2024).

**Critical Defense Finding:** Newman explicitly admitted in testimony "I'm not an expert" when questioned about boilermaker operations, and his methodology relies on a software tool called "ScanWriter" rather than formal forensic accounting procedures. The government has disclosed no Rule 702 expert report for Newman.

## Financial Analysis Methodology

### Newman's Approach
Newman testified to using the following methodology:

1. **ScanWriter Software**: "This is a work paper that I created using software program called ScanWriter, and you take all of those American Express PDF statements, you upload those into ScanWriter."

2. **Template-Based Extraction**: "You choose from a library of templates and say this is an American Express Business Platinum card. ScanWriter knows exactly on that monthly statement where to look for the date, the amount, whether it's a payment or a credit, where the description is."

3. **Automated Processing**: "I click a button and then I sit there and watch the screen for about three hours and then it exports it onto Excel."

4. **Excel Compilation**: "It exported it onto to an Excel spreadsheet, then I created this work paper on Excel and then printed it to a PDF."

### Methodology Limitations (GOOD for Defense)
- **No independent verification** of ScanWriter accuracy
- **No forensic accounting certification** to validate methodology
- **Difficulty with general ledger**: Admitted records were "hard to decipher"
- **Reliance on prosecution summaries** rather than independent analysis
- **No Rule 26 expert report** submitted

## GOOD for Defense (Newman Vulnerabilities)

| Finding | Source | Provenance | Confidence | Defense Strategy |
|---------|--------|------------|------------|------------------|
| NOT a Rule 702 qualified expert | All GJ Transcripts | Multiple | HIGH | Object to opinion testimony; demand Daubert hearing |
| No CPA or CFE certification | Witness profile | sha256:13e250... | HIGH | Challenge foundation for financial conclusions |
| Admitted "I'm not an expert" | Jan 11 GJ, p.12 | sha256:13e250... | HIGH | Use verbatim quote in cross-examination |
| Never seen travel policy like this | Feb 8 GJ (SB Summary) | sha256:d7c167... | HIGH | Shows lack of benchmark knowledge |
| General ledger "hard to decipher" | Apr 3 GJ (SB Summary) | sha256:586686... | HIGH | Challenge accuracy of calculations |
| Government employee bias | DOL affiliation | All documents | MEDIUM | Argue prosecution witness, not independent expert |
| No written IEC policy existed | Nitcher testimony | sha256:2ba525... | HIGH | Subjective LMRDA interpretation |
| ScanWriter methodology unvalidated | Jan 11 GJ | sha256:13e250... | MEDIUM | Challenge Daubert factors (testing, peer review) |

### Key Vulnerability: No Rule 702 Qualification

**Why This Matters:**
Under Federal Rule of Evidence 702, expert testimony requires:
1. Specialized knowledge that will help the trier of fact
2. Testimony based on sufficient facts or data
3. Product of reliable principles and methods
4. Reliable application of those methods to the case facts

Newman is a **lay investigator** testifying about what he observed and did during the investigation. However, the prosecution is using his testimony to:
- Establish loss calculations
- Characterize expenses as "unauthorized"
- Interpret LMRDA requirements
- Draw conclusions about embezzlement

**Defense Motion:** File motion in limine to exclude Newman's opinion testimony on financial matters or require formal Rule 702 qualification.

### Cross-Examination Opportunities

1. **Credentials Challenge:**
   - "Mr. Newman, are you a Certified Public Accountant?"
   - "Are you a Certified Fraud Examiner?"
   - "Have you completed any forensic accounting certification?"
   - "What degree did you receive in 2005?"

2. **Methodology Challenge:**
   - "You testified you 'click a button and sit there for three hours' - did you independently verify each data point ScanWriter extracted?"
   - "What peer review has the ScanWriter methodology undergone?"
   - "Has ScanWriter been accepted in federal courts as a reliable forensic tool?"

3. **Policy Interpretation Challenge:**
   - "You testified you've never seen a premium travel policy like this before - so you have no basis for comparison?"
   - "The IEC had no written policy for executive expenses, correct?"
   - "So your interpretation of 'authorized' expenses is based on your reading of the constitution, not any written policy?"

4. **Government Bias:**
   - "You're being paid by the government to testify today?"
   - "Your job depends on bringing successful prosecutions?"
   - "Did you consider any exculpatory interpretations of the expense data?"

## BAD for Defense (Newman Strengths)

| Finding | Source | Provenance | Confidence |
|---------|--------|------------|------------|
| Extensive testimony (606 pages) | 3 GJ Transcripts | Multiple | HIGH |
| Detailed AMEX analysis ($1.77M international travel) | Feb 8 GJ | sha256:44783... | HIGH |
| Pattern evidence across multiple defendants | All GJ Transcripts | Multiple | HIGH |
| Creeden approved multiple expenses (TSSA, wires to Kate) | Feb 8 GJ (SB Summary) | sha256:d7c167... | HIGH |
| Creeden $1M charges with only $44K reimbursement | Apr 3 GJ (SB Summary) | sha256:586686... | HIGH |
| Outside employment compensation after 2016 prohibition | Feb 8 GJ (SB Summary) | sha256:d7c167... | MEDIUM |
| Vacation payout allegations (67,105 hours for Creeden) | Apr 3 GJ (SB Summary) | sha256:586686... | HIGH |
| LM2 reports signed by Jones AND Creeden | Jan 11 GJ | sha256:13e250... | HIGH |
| Constitutional duty: expenses require IEC approval | Jan 11 GJ | sha256:13e250... | HIGH |

### Specific Evidence Against Creeden (Testified by Newman):

1. **Financial Oversight Role:**
   - Secretary-Treasurer "oversees the finances"
   - Required to sign LM2 reports certifying accuracy
   - Approved wire transfers to Kateryna Jones

2. **Personal Expenditures:**
   - $1 million in charges over investigation period
   - Only $44,000 reimbursed to union
   - 67,105 vacation hours accumulated
   - Bank of Labor salary ($442,000) after outside employment prohibition

3. **Pattern Evidence:**
   - Signed off on Jones family expenses
   - Approved TSSA travel expenses
   - Part of executive leadership making expense decisions

## UGLY for Defense (ESCALATE IMMEDIATELY)

| Finding | Source | Provenance | Confidence | Action Required |
|---------|--------|------------|------------|-----------------|
| Creeden directed vacation payouts to Jones, Kate, and himself | SB Summary (citing Nitcher) | sha256:d7c167... | HIGH | Verify source; prepare response |
| $442,000 bank salary after 2016 prohibition | Feb 8 GJ (SB Summary) | sha256:d7c167... | HIGH | Research constitutional exception argument |
| 67,105 vacation hours = massive payout | Apr 3 GJ (SB Summary) | sha256:586686... | HIGH | Calculate actual amount; find authorization |
| Prosecution has "2022 grand jury records" | SB Summary (p.212) | sha256:d7c167... | HIGH | **SUBPOENA IMMEDIATELY** |
| LM2 signatures = certification of accuracy | Jan 11 GJ | sha256:13e250... | HIGH | Analyze what Creeden actually certified |

### Critical Alert: 2022 Grand Jury Records

**From SB Summary, Page 212:**
> "THERE IS A 2022 GRAND JURY THAT MET RELATED TO THIS CASE. WE NEED TO GET THESE RECORDS."

**Defense Action Required:** File motion to compel production of all 2022 grand jury materials. This predates the current investigation timeline and may contain exculpatory evidence.

## Defense Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. **File Motion in Limine** to exclude Newman's opinion testimony on financial matters absent formal Rule 702 qualification
2. **Subpoena 2022 Grand Jury Records** referenced in April 3, 2024 testimony
3. **Request all ScanWriter validation documentation** and Daubert challenge materials
4. **Obtain FBI FOA Abigayil Russ's work product** - may contain contradictory analysis

### Trial Strategy
1. **Lead with credentials attack** - Newman has NO forensic accounting certifications
2. **Use his own words** - "I'm not an expert" admission is devastating
3. **Challenge methodology** - ScanWriter is not peer-reviewed forensic tool
4. **Exploit policy gap** - Even prosecutor admits "no rules" for executive spending
5. **Argue good-faith reliance** - Expenses processed through normal IBB channels

### Cross-Examination Outline
1. Qualifications (lack thereof)
2. Methodology limitations (ScanWriter, general ledger difficulties)
3. Policy interpretation (no written IEC policy, constitution ambiguity)
4. Bias (government employee, prosecution witness)
5. What he did NOT analyze (authorization documents, IEC approvals)
