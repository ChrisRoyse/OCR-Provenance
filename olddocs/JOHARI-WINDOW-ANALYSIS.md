## QUADRANT 3: HIDDEN FACADE
### Strategic Opportunities Not Yet Fully Emphasized

This quadrant identifies defense-favorable evidence that could be better leveraged.

### A. NEWMAN CREDIBILITY ATTACKS

| Attack Vector | Quote | Source File |
|---------------|-------|-------------|
| **Not an Expert** | "So I'm not an expert on this but I think the boilermakers conducts energy and they work on those boilermakers" | `./fullcase/Creeden_Witness_Folders 1/Newman, Jeremy/2024_1_11_Creeden_Bill_jeremy_newman_grand_jury testimony_transcript.pdf` |
| **Unfamiliar with Accounting** | "they used Great Plains Accounting software, which I am not familiar with" | `./fullcase/Creeden_Witness_Folders 1/Newman, Jeremy/2024_04_03_Jeremy_Newman copy.pdf` |
| **Can't Read Ledger** | "the general ledger of the union is hard to decipher" | `./fullcase/Creeden_Witness_Folders 1/Newman, Jeremy/Copy of 2025_3_14_Creeden_William_2024_4_3_Jeremy_Newman_grand_jury_testimony_SB_summary.docx` |
| **Unvalidated Methodology** | "I created using software program called ScanWriter...I click a button and then I sit there and watch the screen for about three hours" | `./fullcase/Creeden_Witness_Folders 1/Newman, Jeremy/2024_1_11_Creeden_Bill_jeremy_newman_grand_jury testimony_transcript.pdf` |
| **No Rules Exist** | "the prosecutor is saying that the case is more difficult because there are no rules regarding spending for the International Officers" | Newman GJ Summary 4-3 |

**Critical Finding:** Newman provides **NO DIRECT EVIDENCE OF INTENT TO STEAL** - all characterizations are circumstantial.

**Source:** `./docs/JOHARI-02-newman-complete-analysis.md`

### B. COOPERATOR IMPEACHMENT

**STAPP PRIOR INCONSISTENT STATEMENT (CRITICAL)**

| Date | Document | Statement | Source File |
|------|----------|-----------|-------------|
| **2023-08-05** | GJX 27 Affidavit | "After **confirming their unused Vacation balances**, I concluded that Kateryna Jones was entitled to $111,057.62..." | `./fullcase/Creeden_Witness_Folders 1/Stapp, Kathy/GJX 27 Stapp Affidavit.pdf` |
| **2024-12-19** | Plea Agreement | "STAPP approved and executed cash payouts for unused vacation time...where **STAPP knew the recipients had already used that vacation time**" | `./fullcase/Creeden_Witness_Folders 1/Stapp, Kathy/2024_12_19_Creeden_Stapp_Plea_Agreement.pdf` |

**Analysis:** These statements are **mutually exclusive**. One cannot both "confirm unused balances" AND "know recipients had already used" the time. This is textbook impeachment under FRE 613.

**BROWN IMPEACHMENT MATERIAL**

| Factor | Evidence | Source File |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| Personal benefit | Received vacation payouts knowing contrary to policy | Brown Plea Agreement |
| Bar exam funded | IBB paid for his bar preparation | Brown Proffer |
| 35 international trips | Admitted attending "boondoggles" | Brown Proffer |
| Sentence incentive | 60-month cap vs 20-year maximum | Brown Plea Agreement |

**Source:** `./docs/JOHARI-04-cooperator-analysis.md`

### C. DEFENSE-FAVORABLE THEMES

| Theme | Supporting Evidence | Source Files |
|-------|---------------------|--------------|
| **No Written Policy** | "IEC had no written policy" | Nitcher FBI 302 2024-01-10 |
| **Dual Approval System** | "dual approvals as well as that audit" | Bathory GJ |
| **Good Faith Assumption** | "assumed all expenses...were for the benefit of the union" | Nitcher FBI 302 |
| **Broad Authority Memo** | Blake & Uhlig memo on union payments | `./fullcase/HOT/2022_09_20_Blake_Uhlig_Memo_GJX 5 regarding Union Payments to Officers and Employees.pdf` |
| **Newton's Credits** | "$323,000 in credits" back to union | Newman GJ Summary |
| **Canceled Trips** | "majority of Newton's credits...are for canceled trips" | Newman GJ Summary |
| **Not a Jones Loyalist** | Nitcher: "JONES needs to go" | Nitcher FBI 302 |
| **Character Reference** | Cain: Nitcher is "good as gold" | Cain FBI 302 |

## QUADRANT 4: UNKNOWN TERRITORY
### Gaps Suggesting Missing Information

This quadrant identifies information that **should exist but doesn't appear in the database** - areas requiring further investigation.

### A. Documents That SHOULD Exist

| Document | Why It Should Exist | Impact if Found |
|----------|---------------------|-----------------|
| **2022 Grand Jury Records** | Newman references prior GJ | May contain exculpatory material |
| **Defense Expert Reports** | Standard in federal fraud cases | N/A - defense materials |
| **Defendant Proffers** | Post-indictment negotiations | Defendant perspectives |
| **IVP Expense Reports** | Officers submitted regular expenses | Context for "normal" spending |
| **BOL Board Minutes** | $498K/$442K salaries required authorization | May show legitimate approval |
| **Complete AMEX Records** | 17,000 pages exist per Newman | 99.8% of data missing |

### B. Investigation Triggers Unknown

| Question | Gap | Significance |
|----------|-----|--------------|
| What triggered FBI investigation? | 6-month gap between Blake memo (2022-09) and whistleblower (2023-03) | May reveal predicate |
| Who initiated DOL audit? | No clear triggering document | Could show bias |
| Why no defendant interviews? | Standard practice to interview targets | One-sided investigation |

### C. Family Member Involvement

All Jones/Creeden family members received target letters but **NONE were interviewed**:

| Person | Target Letter | Interview | Work Product | Status |
|--------|---------------|-----------|--------------|--------|
| Kate Jones | 2024-01-26 | NONE | NONE | $1.6M unexplained |
| Cullen Jones | 2024-01-26 | NONE | Videos? | $160K/year |
| Shae Jones | 2024-01-26 | NONE | Graphics? | $113K/year |

## METHODOLOGY & PROVENANCE

### Analysis Sources

| Report | File | Key Findings |
|--------|------|--------------|
| Expert Discovery | `./docs/JOHARI-01-expert-document-discovery.md` | No Rule 26 documentation |
| Newman Analysis | `./docs/JOHARI-02-newman-complete-analysis.md` | 15 GOOD, 13 BAD, 3 UGLY findings |

---

## CONCLUSION

The Johari Window analysis reveals a **classic prosecution-oriented case file** with significant blind spots:

1. **Expert Witness Gap**: No formal Rule 26 documentation exists, creating Daubert challenge opportunity
2. **One-Sided Investigation**: No defendant or target family member statements in 731-document database
3. **Financial Data Missing**: 99.8% of credit card records (16,964 of 17,000 AMEX pages) not in evidence
4. **Impeachment Gold**: Stapp's prior inconsistent statement is textbook material for cross-examination
5. **Credibility Attacks**: Newman's admissions ("not an expert," unfamiliar with accounting software) undermine government's lead witness

The defense should immediately pursue the HIGH PRIORITY actions, particularly the Daubert motion and complete AMEX record subpoena, to exploit these blind spots before trial.
