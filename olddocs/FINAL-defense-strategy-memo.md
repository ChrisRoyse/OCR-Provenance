## United States v. Creeden, et al.
## Case No. 2:24-cr-20070-DDC-TJJ

**PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL - ATTORNEY WORK PRODUCT**

**Methodology:** OCR Provenance MCP with SHA-256 verification
**Framework:** USACF v4.0

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This memorandum synthesizes findings from a comprehensive seven-phase analysis of discovery materials in United States v. Creeden. The analysis identified critical vulnerabilities in the government's expert witness strategy, substantial impeachment material against both cooperating witnesses, and powerful defense themes supported by multiple independent witnesses. The government's primary investigator, DOL Senior Investigator Jeremy Newman, lacks Rule 702 qualifications and expressly admitted "I'm not an expert" during grand jury proceedings. This creates an immediate opportunity for Daubert/Rule 702 challenge.

The defense case is strengthened by testimony from IBB Internal Auditor Carolyn Nitcher, who can establish: (1) a dual approval system existed for expenses; (2) no written IEC expense policy existed; (3) staff assumed expenses approved by leadership were for union benefit; and (4) she is not a Newton Jones loyalist, having stated "Jones needs to go." These themes directly undercut the government's theory of willful embezzlement.

However, the defense must confront significant damaging evidence, including cooperator testimony that Kateryna Jones produced no work product, vacation payouts totaling $703,591.88 were approved for recipients who had already used vacation time, and vivid characterizations of international trips as "boondoggles." This memo provides a comprehensive strategy addressing all GOOD, BAD, and UGLY findings with full provenance.

**Cross-Examination Strategy:**

1. **Credentials Challenge:** "Mr. Newman, you are not a CPA, correct?" "You are not a Certified Fraud Examiner?" "You have no forensic accounting certification?" "In fact, you told the grand jury, 'I'm not an expert,' correct?"

2. **Methodology Challenge:** "The ScanWriter software you used - is it scientifically validated? Has it been peer reviewed? What is its known error rate?"

3. **Policy Interpretation Challenge:** "You acknowledged there was no written IEC expense policy, correct? You've never seen a travel policy like the Boilermakers' before?"

4. **Bias Challenge:** "You are a government employee, correct? You are here to assist the prosecution?"

**Motion Practice:**
- File Daubert/Rule 702 motion to exclude Newman's opinion testimony
- Challenge ScanWriter methodology under Daubert factors
- Argue any financial conclusions require qualified expert

| Proffer 302 (2024-03-04) | `./fullcase/Creeden_Witness_Folders 1/Brown, Tyler/2024.3.4_Creeden_302_Proff_Tyler_Brown_RD3_JONES_1305746.pdf` |
| Plea Agreement | `./fullcase/Creeden_Witness_Folders 1/Brown, Tyler/2024_05_23_Creeden_Brown_Plea_Agreement.pdf` |
| Plea Transcript | `./fullcase/Creeden_Witness_Folders 1/Brown, Tyler/2024_05_30_Creeden_Brown_Plea_Transcript.pdf` |

**Damaging Quotes (UGLY for Defense):**

> "Drunker than Cooter Brown. On the union's dime."

> "39 people sat around with nothing to do for four or five days" (Hawaii 2019)

> "wanted to take his 40-year younger wife to nice places on nice jets"

> "could not imagine KATE really did anything for the union"

> "BROWN described the payments hush money"

> "They was going to make an example out of that boy"

**Impeachment Attack Vectors:**

1. **20-year sentence exposure** - Extreme motive to tell government what it wants to hear
2. **Approved fraudulent expenses himself** - Active participant, not passive observer
3. **Bar preparation paid by IBB** - Personally benefited from same system
4. **Traveled 35 times internationally** - Beneficiary of alleged "boondoggles"
5. **Never used vacation for foreign trips** - Same conduct as defendants
6. **Waited 12+ years to report** - Only came forward when investigated
7. **Never verified IBB purpose for expenses** - Yet now claims they were fraudulent

**Cross-Examination Strategy:**

Q: "Mr. Brown, you face up to 20 years in prison, correct?"
Q: "You approved the same expenses you now call fraudulent?"
Q: "You traveled internationally 35 times on union funds?"
Q: "You never reported any of this until investigators contacted you?"

> "Enormous amount of alcohol to his room...on the master account"

> "approved $703,591.88 in vacation payouts knowing recipients had already used that vacation time"

> "Kate/Jones split expenses to make them not look so bad"

> "STAPP does not believe KYLE is a certified architect + $400K spent"

> "JONES created positions to hire all the referenced individuals"

**CRITICAL PRIOR INCONSISTENT STATEMENT:**

| Source | Statement |
|--------|-----------|
| GJX 27 Affidavit (Aug 5, 2023) | Stapp confirmed unused vacation balances, presenting payouts as legitimate |
| Plea Admission (Dec 2024) | Admits she KNEW recipients had already used vacation time |

**Impeachment Attack Vectors:**

1. **Pled guilty to same RICO charge as defendants**
2. **Gave final approval for fraudulent vacation payouts** - Active perpetrator
3. **20-year sentence exposure** - Extreme motive to minimize own role
4. **30 years at IBB** - Participated in culture for decades
5. **Admits intimate knowledge of fraud** - Yet continued approving
6. **Aug 5, 2023 affidavit contradicts plea admission** - PRIOR INCONSISTENT STATEMENT
7. **Continued approving after whistleblower attempt**

**Cross-Examination Strategy:**

Q: "Ms. Stapp, you signed GJX 27 on August 5, 2023, correct?"
Q: "In that affidavit, you confirmed the vacation balances were legitimate unused vacation?"
Q: "Now you're telling this jury they had already used that vacation time?"
Q: "Which version is true - your sworn affidavit or your testimony today?"

### C. Combined Cross-Examination Strategy

**Theme 1: Both Are Admitted Criminals**
- Both pled guilty to RICO Conspiracy
- Both face 20 years imprisonment
- Both need government's cooperation recommendation

**Theme 2: Both Were Active Participants**
- Brown approved expenses he now calls fraudulent
- Stapp gave final approval for vacation payouts
- Neither was a passive observer

**Theme 3: Both Benefited Personally**
- Brown: bar exam paid, 35 international trips
- Stapp: 30-year career, HR Director position
- Same system they now condemn

**Theme 4: Memory and Consistency Issues**
- Testimony reconstructs events 10+ years old
- Both have inconsistencies in prior statements
- Stapp's GJX 27 affidavit vs. plea admission

## SECTION IV: DEFENSE STRATEGY RECOMMENDATIONS

### A. Immediate Actions (0-7 Days)

1. **SUBPOENA 2022 Grand Jury Records** - Newman referenced prior grand jury proceedings; obtain complete record

2. **File Daubert/Rule 702 Motion** - Challenge Newman's qualification to offer expert opinion testimony

3. **Pre-Trial Interview Carolyn Nitcher** - Confirm all FBI 302 statements; assess trial demeanor

4. **Request Complete Abigayil Russ Disclosure** - Demand all work product, notes, calculations under Rule 16

5. **Obtain GJX 27 Affidavit Original** - Verify August 5, 2023 date for Stapp impeachment

### B. Short-Term Actions (7-30 Days)

1. **Retain Forensic Accountant** - Counter Newman's calculations; verify vacation hours; audit AMEX analysis

2. **Retain Union Governance Expert** - Constitutional interpretation; LMRDA standards; IP authority

3. **Prepare Nitcher Direct Examination** - Focus on dual approval, no written policy, assumption of legitimacy

4. **Develop KATE Work Product Search** - Ukraine contacts, translation work, international liaison documentation

5. **Research Constitutional Authority** - Noble v. Sombrotto; Morrissey v. Curran; IP discretion cases

6. **Interview Corroborating Witnesses** - James Cain, John Fultz, Ashley Bathory, Arnie Stadnick

### C. Expert Retention Recommendations

| Expert Type | Purpose | Priority |
|-------------|---------|----------|
| Forensic Accountant (CPA/CFE) | Counter Newman calculations; vacation payout analysis; AMEX verification | CRITICAL |
| Union Governance Expert | Constitutional interpretation; LMRDA compliance; IP authority | HIGH |
| Labor Relations Expert | Industry standards for union officer compensation/expenses | MEDIUM |

### D. Motion Practice

| Motion | Basis | Priority |
|--------|-------|----------|
| Daubert/Rule 702 Challenge | Newman lacks qualifications; ScanWriter unvalidated | CRITICAL |
| Motion to Compel | Abigayil Russ complete disclosure | HIGH |
| Motion in Limine | Exclude Newton Jones drinking/character evidence (FRE 404) | HIGH |
| Subpoena | 2022 Grand Jury records | CRITICAL |
| Motion for Bill of Particulars | Specify which expenses alleged fraudulent | MEDIUM |

### E. Trial Themes

1. **Dual Approval System** - Creeden was one of two required approvers; cannot embezzle from himself

2. **No Written Policy** - Government cannot prove violation of policy that did not exist

3. **Good Faith Reliance** - Staff assumed expenses were legitimate; industry practice to trust IP

4. **Constitutional Authority** - IP has broad discretion under union constitution; courts defer

5. **Cooperator Credibility** - Both face 20 years; both participated; both have inconsistencies

6. **Government Witness Limitations** - Newman is not an expert; methodology unvalidated
