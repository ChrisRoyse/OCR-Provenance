# Phase 5: Cooperating Witness Analysis Report
## United States v. Creeden - Tyler Brown & Kathy Stapp
**Case Number:** 2:24-cr-20070-DDC-TJJ
**Generated:** 2026-02-05

## Executive Summary

Two cooperating witnesses have pled guilty and will testify against the defendants in United States v. Creeden. Both occupied critical positions within the International Brotherhood of Boilermakers (IBB) and possess intimate knowledge of the alleged criminal enterprise:

1. **Tyler Brown** - Chief of Staff to International President Newton Jones (2018-2022), pled guilty to RICO Conspiracy on May 23, 2024
2. **Kathy Stapp** - Administrative Assistant to IST/Director of HR (2010-present), pled guilty to RICO Conspiracy on December 19, 2024

Both cooperators have provided extensive proffer statements detailing alleged misuse of union funds, nepotism, fraudulent vacation payouts, and a culture of fear/retaliation that prevented accountability. Their testimony will be devastating to the defense, but significant attack vectors exist based on their own culpability, motives for cooperation, and potential inconsistencies.

### Proffer Session Analysis (March 4, 2024)

The proffer was conducted at the Robert J. Dole Federal Courthouse, Kansas City, KS. Present were:
- FBI SA Scott B. Macke (overtly recorded)
- DOL SI Jeremy Newman
- AUSA Faiza Alhambra
- AUSA Jabari Wamble
- DOJ Senior Trial Attorney Vincent Falvo
- Defense Counsel: Braden Perry, Brian Kuester, Ellen Comley, John Sellers (via telephone)

**Key Statements from Brown's Proffer:**

#### On Jones's Alcoholism and Work Ethic:
> "Meetings were supposed to start at 8:00 am and JONES would routinely not show up until 10:00, if at all... JONES was 'drunk most of the time. He drank mimosas for breakfast, prosecco for lunch and wine for dinner.'"

> "The running joke was, 'if you didn't get Newt between 8 and noon you might as well forget it and that window of time to get him was getting shorter and shorter at the end because he was lit. Drunker than Cooter Brown. On the union's dime.'"

#### On Jones's Ukraine Travel:
> "JONES spent 'a significant amount of time over there (Ukraine).' JONES' travel to Ukraine 'raised plenty of attention.'... Those that were aware of JONES' purpose of travel to Ukraine knew, '...it was about his wife.'"

#### On Conference Boondoggles:
> Regarding the October 2019 Hawaii trip for a utility workers union merger that never happened: "IBB sent 39 attendees for the meeting... They didn't have to be there... 39 people sat around with nothing to do. They sat around for four or five days."

> "BROWN agreed the trips were a 'colossal waste of money.'"

#### On Kate Jones's Back Pay:
> "BROWN, STAPP, BILL, and JONES were responsible for KATE's back pay when she came to the United States. BROWN could not imagine KATE really did anything for the union while in Ukraine, but KATE received over $100,000.00."

#### On Cullen Jones:
> "CULLEN did not do much and BROWN was not aware of any work products from CULLEN. CULLEN was employed because of his relationship with JONES."

> Regarding CULLEN being fired after a physical altercation with girlfriend Laura Goulding: "IBB paid for GOULDING's relocation to Canada which included a salary and apartment lease... BROWN described the payments hush money."

#### On Retaliation Culture:
> "Anyone who questioned or opposed JONES was retaliated against."

> Regarding Bryan Opland who ran against the slate: "They was going to make an example out of that boy."

#### On Expense Oversight:
> "BROWN never recalled IVP's reviewing JONES' IBB expenses at any IEC meetings."

> When BILL announced expense reports for review: "No one wanted to review the expenses and they were approved via motions."

### Proffer Session Analysis (August 18, 2023)

The proffer was conducted at the Robert J. Dole Federal Courthouse, Kansas City, KS. Present were:
- FBI SA Scott B. Macke (overtly recorded)
- FBI SA Mitchell Gleason
- DOL SI Jeremy Newman
- AUSA Faiza Alhambra
- AUSA Jabari Wamble
- DOJ Senior Trial Attorney Vincent Falvo
- Defense Counsel: W. Scott Toth

**Key Statements from Stapp's Proffer:**

#### On Expense Approval Culture:
> "STAPP said IBB operated under the assumption that if JONES said it was a business expense, it was a business expense. STAPP said, 'He's (JONES) the IP, he knows the rules,' when it came to documenting the purpose for expenses."

> "STAPP said no one wanted to question or push back against JONES' expenditures."

#### On Marco Island Alcohol Bill:
> "STAPP recalled JONES charged, 'Enormous amount of alcohol to his room...on the master account.'... STAPP said the amount of alcohol on the bill by JONES was 'unreasonable.'"

> Stapp color-coded the bill and sent it to Jones for reimbursement: "JONES paid a portion of the bill and did not address the rest."

#### On Kate Jones:
> "STAPP was not sure what KATE did in Ukraine for the IBB (supposedly she was translating flyers for distribution in Seattle, Washington)."

> "STAPP was directed by IBB attorneys that KATE could not be paid while she was living in Ukraine. STAPP did not understand how the IBB could pay KATE retroactively for the work."

> "STAPP could not definitively say what KATE did for the IBB. STAPP was not aware of any work product(s) produced by KATE, ever."

#### On Whistleblower Attempt:
> "Following the Marco Island conference, STAPP sought whistleblower protection through IVP John Fultz (FULTZ) and Timothy Simmons (SIMMONS). STAPP, 'Thought his (JONES) spending was so far out of line and getting worse and worse.'"

#### On Vacation Payouts:
> "STAPP recently approved large vacation payments to JONES, KATE, and BILL (over 370 days paid)."

> "STAPP said BILL sometimes takes vacation but does not submit the time for vacation... In essence, BILL was not at work and got paid his salary without using vacation time."

#### On Nepotism:
> "JONES determined the salary for all these individuals. JONES created positions to hire all the referenced individuals."

> "All of JONES' family members and BILL's family members are staff regardless of their tenure at IBB. Some employees have worked longer at IBB without the benefit of being staff."

#### On Kyle Creeden's Architecture:
> "To date, well over $400,000.00 of IBB funds have been spent on architecture designs and interior design plans (no actual work done) for the building... STAPP does not believe KYLE is a certified architect."

### Plea Agreement Terms

**Type:** Rule 11 Plea Agreement (December 19, 2024)

**Factual Basis Admitted (Critical Admissions):**

1. **Approving fraudulent domestic conference expenses**: "approving expenses for domestic meetings... which included expenses for unnecessary attendees up to thirty-eight (38) persons including lavish accommodations, food and drink, and for periods where no legitimate business of the Boilermakers Union was conducted"

2. **Approving fraudulent international trips**: "approving expenses for dozens of international trips... to Italy on at least seven (7) occasions between 2014 and 2022... unnecessary persons, level of accommodations, expensive side trips, and for periods where no legitimate business... was conducted"

3. **Approving fraudulent employment**: "approving and executing employment with the Boilermakers Union for Kateryna Jones, Cullen Jones, and other members of the Jones family with full benefits and reimbursed expenses when the individuals placed in those positions were not required to work full-time, and did not perform productive work commensurate with full-time employment"

4. **Approving fraudulent relocation expenses**: "approving and executing relocation expenses for Cullen Jones, and other members of the Jones family, where the expenses were contrary to the policies of the Boilermakers Union"

5. **Healthcare fraud**: "placing ineligible persons on the Boilermakers Union Health Care plan, including Kateryna Jones, Cullen Jones, and Individual Number One and his dependents where they would be able to gain reimbursement for medical care and treatment to which they were not entitled"

6. **Fraudulent vacation payouts**: "STAPP approved and executed cash payouts for unused vacation time... which were contrary to the terms of the vacation policy... and where STAPP knew the recipients had already used that vacation time. In July 2023... STAPP approved direct deposits to Newton Jones for $107,733.52, William Creeden for $484,800.74 and Kateryna Jones for $111,057.62 purportedly for unused vacation."

**Cooperation Requirements:**
- Full cooperation with investigation and trial
- Truthful testimony
- Must resign IBB membership as of plea date
- Barred from IBB employment for 13 years post-sentence

**Government Agreements:**
- Dismiss remaining counts and forfeiture allegation
- Recommend no restitution
- Recommend no fines
- Recommend 2-level acceptance of responsibility reduction (plus 1 additional if offense level 16+)

### Grand Jury Exhibit 27 - Stapp Affidavit (August 5, 2023)

**CRITICAL DOCUMENT** - This sworn affidavit executed before her proffer shows Stapp documenting the vacation payout calculations:

> "In mid-July 2023, I was verbally directed by Mr. Creedon to calculate vacation pay for Kateryna Jones, Newton Jones, and William Creedon, following their emailed requests. After confirming their unused Vacation balances, I concluded that:
> - Kateryna Jones was entitled to $111,057.62
> - Newton Jones was entitled to $107,733.52
> - William Creedon was entitled to $484,800.74
>
> The Accounting Department prepared payroll direct deposits for each of them accordingly. I reviewed and gave final approval for the payroll."

**Defense Note:** This affidavit was executed BEFORE her proffer and shows her processing payments she now admits were fraudulent. It can be used to show she was an active participant, not a passive observer.

### Expected Testimony

Based on her proffer and plea agreement, Stapp will likely testify about:

1. **Day-to-day financial operations** - She functioned as "day-to-day financial officer" during Creeden's absences
2. **Expense approval process** - How expenses were rubber-stamped
3. **Kate Jones's employment fraud** - No work product, retroactive pay scheme, healthcare enrollment
4. **Jones family nepotism** - Salary determinations, position creation, relocation benefits
5. **Vacation payout fraud** - The $703,591.88 in fraudulent July 2023 payouts (Newton + Kate + Bill)
6. **Marco Island alcohol scandal** - Unreasonable alcohol charges, partial reimbursement
7. **Kyle Creeden architecture scam** - $400,000+ for no actual work, not a certified architect
8. **Foreign travel abuses** - No union purpose for Ukraine trips, Italy trips
9. **MORE Fund irregularities** - Moving money between funds
10. **Whistleblower attempt** - Her efforts to report through Fultz/Simmons

## Combined Defense Strategy for Cooperators

### Cross-Examination Themes

#### Theme 1: They Are Admitted Criminals Seeking Leniency
- Both pled guilty to RICO Conspiracy (20-year max)
- Their only path to reduced sentences is cooperation
- Government controls recommendation at sentencing
- Powerful motive to tell government what it wants to hear

#### Theme 2: They Were Active Participants, Not Passive Observers
- Brown: Approved expenses, participated in Kate's back pay, traveled internationally 35 times
- Stapp: "Gave final approval" for vacation payouts, approved fraudulent expenses for years
- Both had power to stop the conduct - neither did

#### Theme 3: They Benefited Personally From the Same System
- Brown: Bar preparation paid by IBB, extensive international travel
- Stapp: Made "staff member" with superior benefits, 30+ years of employment
- Neither reported to external authorities despite knowing of misconduct

#### Theme 4: Their Testimony is Reconstructed Memory
- Events span 2010-2023
- Neither took contemporaneous notes of most events
- Proffer statements are summaries, not verbatim
- Both acknowledge recordings should be reviewed for "actual words spoken"

#### Theme 5: Inconsistencies and Evolved Testimony
- Stapp: August 5, 2023 affidavit presents vacation payouts as legitimate; by December 2024 admits fraud
- Brown: Plea petition says he "participated in misappropriation" but proffer casts himself as helpless

### Impeachment Material Identified

| Witness | Prior Statement | Inconsistency | Source |

| Brown | "BROWN never verified the IBB purpose for JONES' credit card expenses" | Yet claims he was "helpless" to stop fraud | Proffer p.2 |
| Brown | Never reported to authorities | Claims to have known of misconduct for 12+ years | Timeline |
| Stapp | "Sought whistleblower protection" | Never actually filed external complaint | Proffer p.3 |

## Conclusion

Tyler Brown and Kathy Stapp will be powerful prosecution witnesses with devastating insider knowledge. However, both are admitted felons with strong motives to cooperate, and both were active participants in the very conduct they will describe. The defense has substantial ammunition for cross-examination, particularly:

1. **Stapp's August 5, 2023 affidavit** contradicts her plea admission - she originally presented the vacation payouts as legitimate calculations, now admits she knew recipients had already used that vacation time

2. **Brown's personal benefits** from the same system he condemns - 35 international trips, bar exam paid by IBB, vacation time inconsistencies

3. **Neither reported externally** despite claiming to have known of misconduct for years

The defense should prepare to paint these witnesses as co-conspirators who only turned on their colleagues when facing decades in prison.
