## CRITICAL: Prior Inconsistent Statement Analysis

### Statement 1: GJX 27 Affidavit (August 5, 2023)

**Document:** GJX 27 Stapp Affidavit.pdf  
**Document ID:** d90a9efc-4964-4f23-bfaa-79c180d7bd50  
**Provenance Hash:** sha256:051999a8f8d3bdd571f5effd6909c4765d4f030ca02369c3646b6112a62456fa

**Exact Quote:**
> "After **confirming their unused Vacation balances**, I concluded that Kateryna Jones was entitled to $111,057.62; Newton Jones was entitled to $107,733.52; and William Creedon was entitled to $484,800.74."

**Key Language:** "confirming their unused Vacation balances"

**Implication:** The August 2023 affidavit states that Stapp CONFIRMED the vacation balances were UNUSED before processing the payments.

### Statement 2: Plea Agreement (December 19, 2024)

**Document:** 2024_12_19_Creeden_Stapp_Plea_Agreement.pdf  
**Document ID:** 0c847fcd-94a6-4f32-9dfd-134482ca33c9  
**Provenance Hash:** sha256:664f796f428078078f90e34b73234e9f97854d7652144fefcc04c3899aa91200

**Exact Quote:**
> "STAPP approved and executed cash payouts for unused vacation time for numerous employees of the Boilermakers Union, including Newton Jones, William Creeden, and Kateryna Jones, which were contrary to the terms of the vacation policy of the Boilermakers Union adopted in 2015, and where **STAPP knew the recipients had already used that vacation time**."

**Key Language:** "STAPP knew the recipients had already used that vacation time"

**Implication:** The December 2024 plea agreement admits that Stapp KNEW the vacation time had ALREADY BEEN USED when she processed the payments.

---

### The Contradiction

| Date | Document | Stapp's Statement |
|------|----------|-------------------|
| August 5, 2023 | GJX 27 Affidavit | "confirming their **unused** Vacation balances" |
| December 19, 2024 | Plea Agreement | "STAPP **knew the recipients had already used** that vacation time" |

**Time Gap:** 16 months between statements

**Nature of Contradiction:** 
- In August 2023, Stapp signed a declaration under penalty of perjury stating she CONFIRMED the vacation time was UNUSED
- In December 2024, Stapp admitted she KNEW the vacation time had ALREADY BEEN USED

**This is a direct factual contradiction that cannot be reconciled.**

---

### Impeachment Value

This prior inconsistent statement is available for:

1. **Cross-examination of Stapp** if called as government witness
2. **Challenge to Stapp's credibility** as a cooperating witness
3. **Evidence of potential perjury** in the August 2023 affidavit
4. **Argument that Stapp's testimony is unreliable** and inconsistent
5. **Support for defense theory** that Stapp is shifting blame to avoid responsibility
