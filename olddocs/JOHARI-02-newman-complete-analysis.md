## Executive Summary

Jeremy Newman is the Department of Labor Senior Investigator who serves as the government's lead investigator in this case. While presented as an expert witness, Newman has made multiple admissions that undermine his expertise and the reliability of his methodology. His testimony reveals significant analytical limitations, unfamiliarity with the union's accounting systems, and reliance on subjective characterizations rather than objective standards.

## UGLY Findings (Catastrophic)

| Finding | Quote | Source File |

## Cross-Examination Ammunition

### 1. Attack Expertise/Qualifications

**Q:** Mr. Newman, you testified you are "not an expert" on what boilermakers actually do for a living. Is that correct?
- Source: 2024_1_11 transcript, p.12-13

**Q:** You admitted you have never seen an international travel policy in any union you've investigated before this case, correct?
- Source: Summary 2-8, p.4-5

**Q:** The accounting software used by the Boilermakers - Great Plains - you admitted you are "not familiar with" it, correct?
- Source: 2024_04_03 transcript, p.9-10

**Q:** In fact, you said the general ledger was "hard to decipher" and you couldn't tell "who the payee was" or "the purpose of any of the payments," isn't that right?
- Source: 2024_04_03 transcript, p.10-11

### 2. Attack Methodology

**Q:** Your analysis was performed using ScanWriter software where you admit you simply "click a button and then sit there and watch the screen for about three hours" - is that your forensic methodology?
- Source: 2024_1_11 transcript, p.214-215

**Q:** You testified that you had to delete or hide columns of data to fit your exhibits on one page. Isn't selective presentation of evidence a concern in forensic analysis?
- Source: 2024_04_03 transcript, p.13

**Q:** You're still waiting on the general ledger in a format you can actually read, aren't you?
- Source: 2024_04_03 transcript, p.12

### 3. Attack Subjective Characterizations

**Q:** You used the words "very odd" multiple times in your testimony. Can you point to a single federal statute or DOL regulation that makes "very odd" conduct criminal?
- Source: 2024_2_8 transcript, p.40-41

**Q:** You described meals as "highly suspect." That's your opinion, not a forensic finding, correct?
- Source: 2024_1_11 transcript, p.236-237

**Q:** You admitted there are "no rules regarding spending for International Officers" - so on what standard are you basing your suspicion?
- Source: Summary 4-3, p.25-26

### 4. Attack Understanding of Union Structure

**Q:** You testified that international officers are NOT under a per diem, correct?
- Source: Summary 4-3, p.20

**Q:** You mischaracterized William Creeden's authority - you said he "has to okay expenses" when the IBB Constitution doesn't say that, does it?
- Source: Summary 2-8, p.44

**Q:** You never dealt with an "international union" before this case, correct?
- Source: 2024_2_8 transcript, p.40-41

### 5. Attack Timeline/Bias

**Q:** The whistleblower came forward AFTER the investigation started, isn't that right? So this investigation was not prompted by a whistleblower complaint?
- Source: Summary 2-8, p.100

**Q:** The prosecutor himself told the grand jury the case is "more difficult because there are no rules" - you were present for that statement?
- Source: Summary 4-3, p.25-26

### 6. Highlight Exculpatory Evidence

**Q:** You documented that the majority of Newton's credits back to the union were for canceled trips - meaning expenses that were never actually incurred?
- Source: Summary 4-3, p.17-18

**Q:** Newton made over $323,000 in credits back to the union during the relevant period, correct?
- Source: Summary 4-3, p.22

## Blind Spots (What Wasn't Found That Should Exist)

1. **Newman's CV/Resume** - No document found showing Newman's educational background, certifications (CPA, CFE, etc.), or formal forensic accounting training.

2. **ScanWriter Validation** - No evidence that ScanWriter software is validated, peer-reviewed, or accepted by courts as reliable forensic methodology.

3. **Comparison to Other Unions** - No statistical comparison showing IBB spending is abnormal compared to unions of similar size/scope with international operations.

4. **Defense Interview** - No evidence Newman interviewed the defendant or gave him opportunity to explain expenses before characterizing them as suspicious.

5. **First Newman Summary (2024-1-11)** - The document `Copy of 2025_3_12_Creeden_William_2024_1_11_Jeremy_Newman_grand_jury_testimony_SB_summary.docx` was listed in the directory but not fully indexed for search.

6. **DOL Reports** - Files `2024.4.30_Creeden_302_DOL_Report_Jerry_Newman_RD3_JONES_1306143.pdf` and `2024.4.30_Creeden_302_DOL_Report_Jerry_Newman_Copy_RD3_JONES_1306155.pdf` exist but were not searchable for specific content.

7. **Newman's Prior Testimony** - No prior cases where Newman testified as expert, which could reveal pattern of similar characterizations or Daubert challenges.

8. **Great Plains Training** - No evidence Newman received any training on Great Plains accounting software before attempting to analyze IBB's books.

9. **Intent Evidence** - Critical gap: Newman documents amounts and patterns but provides NO direct evidence of intent to defraud. All characterizations are inferential.

10. **IBB Constitution Analysis** - No evidence Newman thoroughly analyzed the IBB Constitution to understand the authority granted to the International President for discretionary spending.

---

## Strategic Assessment

### Newman's Weaknesses as a Witness:

1. **Not a Rule 702 Expert** - He has not been formally qualified. Multiple admissions undermine any expert characterization.

2. **Methodology is Questionable** - ScanWriter automation + unfamiliarity with accounting system + selective data presentation = Daubert vulnerability.

3. **Subjective Opinions** - "Very odd," "highly suspect," "unusual" - these are opinions, not forensic findings.

4. **Lack of Standards** - Admits no rules exist for International Officers' spending, yet characterizes spending as suspicious.

5. **Incomplete Analysis** - Still waiting on ledger format; couldn't identify payees; didn't understand codes.

### Newman's Strengths as a Witness:

1. **Volume of Documentation** - 606+ pages of detailed testimony creates comprehensive record.

2. **Specific Dollar Amounts** - Hard numbers ($2.6M, $840K, $442K) are concrete and damaging.

3. **Pattern Evidence** - 123 international trips, family relocation expenses, dual employment create pattern.

4. **Government Authority** - DOL Senior Investigator title carries weight with juries.

---

## Recommended Defense Strategy

1. **Daubert Challenge** - File motion to exclude Newman's testimony as expert opinion. Focus on:
   - Lack of specialized training in Great Plains accounting
   - No validation of ScanWriter methodology
   - Admission of unfamiliarity with subject matter
   - Subjective characterizations without objective standards

2. **Cross-Examination Focus** - Use his own admissions against him. Every "I'm not an expert" and "I'm not familiar with" should be hammered.

3. **Context Counter** - Present actual IBB Constitution and policies to show discretionary authority existed.

4. **Intent Gap** - Emphasize Newman provides NO evidence of intent - only circumstantial patterns.

5. **Credits/Reimbursements** - Highlight $323,000 in credits, canceled trips, and protest notations as evidence of good faith.
