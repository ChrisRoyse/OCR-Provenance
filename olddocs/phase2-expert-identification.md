## Executive Summary

**Critical Finding: NO FORMAL RULE 702 EXPERTS IDENTIFIED IN DISCOVERY**

This comprehensive review of 731 documents in the "fullcase" database reveals the government has NOT disclosed any formally retained expert witnesses with Rule 702 reports. Instead, the prosecution relies heavily on **quasi-expert testimony** from government employees, primarily:

1. **Jeremy Newman** - DOL Senior Investigator (Primary Quasi-Expert)
2. **Abigayil Russ** - FBI Forensic Accountant (Secondary Quasi-Expert)

Additionally, **Carolyn Nitcher** (IBB Internal Auditor) emerges as a **high-value potential defense witness** due to her statements about fear-based culture, lack of written policy for executives, and her role in approving expenses.

- Introduction of RICO case framework to grand jury
- Presented as "labor racketeering case"
- LMRDA enforcement background
- Initial presentation of evidence

**February 8, 2024 Grand Jury Appearance:**

**Key Quote from April 3, 2024 Transcript:**
> "Labor Management Reporting and Disclosure Act; that is the act that has the fiduciary duties of the union. It governs all of their internal procedures, trusteeship, elections and so forth, and it has our -- our make-way crime here, embezzlement from a labor organization."
> -- Vincent Falvo explaining Newman's enforcement role

### 1.4 Defense Vulnerability Assessment

**CRITICAL CHALLENGE OPPORTUNITIES:**

1. **Not a Formal Expert**: Newman is a lay witness testifying about his investigation, NOT a formally retained expert under Rule 702. Defense should:
   - Object to any "opinion" testimony about financial analysis
   - Demand Daubert hearing if prosecution attempts expert qualification
   - Move to limit testimony to factual observations only

2. **LMRDA Interpretation Issues**: Newman enforces LMRDA but:
   - IEC (International Executive Council) had NO WRITTEN POLICY per Nitcher testimony
   - Expenses were approved through established IBB processes
   - Defense can argue good-faith reliance on internal approval

3. **Lack of Embezzlement Expertise**: Newman is an investigator, not:
   - A forensic accountant
   - A certified fraud examiner
   - An expert in union financial governance

4. **Cross-Examination Focus Areas:**
   - What formal expert qualifications does Newman hold?
   - Did DOL provide formal expert report under Rule 26?
   - What training in forensic accounting?
   - Difference between policy violation vs. criminal embezzlement

**From Stadnick Interview 302:**
> "Also present were FBI Forensic Accountant (FOA) Abigayil Russ, Antonio Ruiz, and David Rosenfeld (STADNICK's counsel)."

### 2.4 Defense Action Items

1. **Request All Work Product**: Demand production of any reports, analyses, or memoranda prepared by FOA Russ
2. **Expert Disclosure**: If prosecution intends to call Russ as expert, demand Rule 26 disclosure
3. **Limited Visibility Concern**: Single mention suggests possible undisclosed analytical work

### 3.3 Defense Value Assessment

**EXTREMELY HIGH VALUE FOR DEFENSE**

Nitcher's statements provide multiple defense theories:

#### A. Fear-Based Culture Defense
**Key Quote (FBI 302, 2024-01-10):**
> "NITCHER was scared daily at her job and would not question JONES expenses, or those close to him, for fear of losing her job."

**Defense Application:** If the internal auditor was too afraid to question expenses, this demonstrates:
- Systemic organizational dysfunction
- Lack of meaningful oversight
- Creeden may have relied on flawed approval process

#### B. No Written Policy for Executives
**Key Quote (FBI 302, 2024-01-10):**
> "However, the International Executive Council (IEC; comprised of IP, IST, IVPs) had no written policy, but were held to the IBB Constitution and Labor Standards/Rules for expenditure of IBB funds."

**Defense Application:** Without written policy:
- No clear standard for "unauthorized" expenses
- Constitution interpretation is subjective
- Good-faith belief in authorization

#### C. Approval Process Existed
**Key Quote (FBI 302, 2024-01-10):**
> "NITCHER assumed all expenses made by JONES, BILL, and IVPs were for the benefit of the union."

**Defense Application:**
- Internal auditor presumed legitimacy
- Expenses processed through normal channels
- No red flags triggered during Nitcher's review

#### D. Retaliation Pattern (Character Evidence)
**Key Quote (FBI 302, 2024-01-10):**
> "NITCHER was sent to audit locals by JONES in retaliation for opposing JONES."

**Defense Application:**
- Newton Jones controlled audit targeting
- Retaliatory environment may explain Creeden's compliance
- Fear of retaliation affected all employees

### 3.4 Key Quotes (Verbatim with Citations)

**On Job Duties and AMEX Review:**
> "NITCHER received American Express (AMEX) credit card statements for NEWTON, Kateryna Jones (KATE), former International Secretary Treasurer (IST) William Creeden (BILL), and International Vice Presidents (IVPs). NITCHER had a 'short window' to review the expenses to pay the AMEX bill to avoid late fees. NITCHER would quickly review the purchases and looked for obvious discrepancies."
> -- FBI 302, January 10, 2024, Page 2

**On Never Seeing Receipts:**
> "NITCHER never saw receipts for expenditures."
> -- FBI 302, January 10, 2024, Page 2

**On Being Told Not to Question:**
> "NITCHER expressed concern over the charges. BROWN became angry and went to BILL over NITCHER's questioning. NITCHER was told by JOHNSON that the expenses were approved and 'don't question' them."
> -- FBI 302, January 10, 2024, Page 2

**On Delegates Not Knowing Expenses:**
> "Delegates approved expenses every five years at IBB National Conventions, but the delegates really had no idea how the money was really spent."
> -- FBI 302, January 10, 2024, Page 5

### 3.5 Grand Jury Testimony (May 2, 2024)

Nitcher appeared before the grand jury WITHOUT counsel. Key testimony points:

**On Her Background:**
> "I graduated from the University of Kansas. I got a bachelor's in general studies, and then I went to Washburn University in Topeka and I got a master's in accounting."

**On Compliance Auditor Duties:**
> "My job was a little varied in that I -- so we have International representatives that are throughout the United States and Canada, and so when they got expense report -- when they filled out expense reports, they would send them to me and I would go through them and I would audit them, essentially. I would look at them, make sure that I had all of the receipts, that everything was reasonable and that everything added up."

**On DOL as Watchdog:**
> "The Department of Labor is the watchdog of the International Brotherhood of Boilermakers, so if there is, let's just say that there would be fraud with a local lodge, they don't call the local sheriff and say hey, we've got fraud; they would call the Department of Labor."

## 4. Other Witnesses Mentioning Internal Audit Function

### 4.1 Lisa West Interview (March 14, 2023)
**Document ID:** 1d7c4626-aafd-490a-b1b5-e42fa74fabe4
**SHA-256:** sha256:b2ce79429df2ddabac51337df874d02d6779ca10ec8a400ee45d30e08c055c05

**Key Quote:**
> "Caroline Nitcher was the IBB internal auditor. She classified the documents for IBB. She did not catch the expenditures that were not covered under policy that the review led by SIMMONS found."

**Defense Application:** Even with audit function, policy violations were not identified - suggests ambiguous standards.

### 4.2 Luke Voigt Interview (April 13, 2023)
**Document ID:** fb31e421-f588-43ea-88e1-eeab2591087c
**SHA-256:** sha256:ed9bf59bb266baefd38a1289c4f2d189c2774aeeb6e7a6702c6ac1a0ffd8321a

**Key Quote:**
> "NEWTON retaliated by sending the IBB internal auditor, Carolyn Nitcher (NITCHER) to conduct an audit into local 647 to look for reasons to remove him from the position. NITCHER would not tell VOIGT what prompted the audit but asked him about the resolutions VOIGT submitted during the convention. It was obvious to VOIGT the audit was done in retaliation. The audit did not yield any discrepancies outside of administrative findings."

**Defense Application:** Audits used as weapons by Newton Jones; Nitcher deployed as tool of retaliation.

### 4.3 Mike Johnson Interview (June 28, 2023)
**Document ID:** 6b24752d-c445-4e55-9fdb-655e3ecae3aa
**SHA-256:** sha256:7cac5f995be761ea9062bac7e0326437e64de38a75b4090754dc8951ab85d4c1

**Key Quote:**
> "JOHNSON was put under Carolyn Nitcher (NITCHER), the internal auditor, but he resigned a few weeks later. JOHNSON had a lot of respect for NITCHER but did not have interest in doing that type of work."
