## Executive Summary

Carolyn Nitcher is a **KEY POTENTIAL DEFENSE WITNESS** who served as IBB's Internal Auditor/Compliance Auditor for 17 years (2006-2023). Her testimony is critical because:

1. **She APPROVED expenses** that are now being charged as embezzlement
2. **She can establish** that a formal authorization process existed
3. **She documents a FEAR-BASED culture** that explains why employees did not question expenses
4. **She was NOT a Newton Jones loyalist** - she expressed discontent and said "JONES needs to go"
5. **She is described as "good as gold"** by fellow witnesses - strong credibility

**DEFENSE VALUE: EXTREMELY HIGH**

Her testimony cuts both ways: while she can establish authorization processes existed, she also provides evidence of improper expenses she processed but could not question due to fear of retaliation.

## Role in Expense Approval Process

Nitcher was central to IBB's expense review workflow, making her testimony critical to understanding whether proper authorization existed.

### Position in Organizational Structure

```
INTERNATIONAL PRESIDENT OFFICE (IPO)          INTERNATIONAL SECRETARY OFFICE (ISO)
------------------------------------          ------------------------------------
- Auditing Department (NITCHER)               - Accounting Department
- Organizing Sector                           - Human Resources
- Industrial Sector                           - Mike Johnson (financials)
- Construction Sector

  [President's Side - Right of Elevator]      [Secretary-Treasurer's Side - Left]
```

**Key Quote (Grand Jury):** "When you got off the elevator, to the right was the International president's side and to the left was International secretary-treasurer, and that was set up for checks and balances."

### Expense Approval Chain

Based on Grand Jury testimony (Ashley Bathory, 2024-03-07):

```
STEP 1: Expenses Submitted
         |
         v
STEP 2: AUDITING DEPARTMENT (Nitcher) - Initial Review
         | - Look for missing receipts
         | - Check for discrepancies
         v
STEP 3: PRESIDENT'S SIDE APPROVAL
         | - Tyler Brown (Chief of Staff) OR
         | - Tracy Buck (Admin)
         v
STEP 4: SECRETARY-TREASURER'S SIDE APPROVAL
         | - Kathy Stapp OR
         | - Susie Skinner (before retirement)
         v
STEP 5: ACCOUNTING DEPARTMENT - Payment via Check
```

**Critical Defense Evidence (Bathory Grand Jury):**
> "So once you had dual approvals as well as that audit, then it could come to the accounting department for payments via check."

### Nitcher's Specific Duties

1. **Review of invoices, direct expense reports, and expense reports**
2. **Review AMEX credit card statements** for Newton Jones, Kateryna Jones, William Creeden, and IVPs
3. **Audit local IBB lodges** throughout US and Canada
4. **Training** of local lodge secretary-treasurers and presidents
5. **Recommend expenses for approval** but did not have final approval authority

## GOOD for Defense (Defense Value)

| Finding | Source | Provenance | Confidence | Defense Strategy |
|---------|--------|------------|------------|------------------|
| Dual approval system existed | Bathory Grand Jury | sha256:c125e3f0ef03e491bb410b5fee29a006a74352999029b71f43a46b41322a6a8f | HIGH | Expenses went through proper channels |

| IVPs "approved their own expenses" | FBI 302 (2023-06-02) | sha256:5f6fb58e4dc012c256ce3867b2fe2e24d1097b8a122154cd0d6c0d2524142c5d | HIGH | Self-authorization was standard |
| "Good as gold" reputation | Cain FBI 302 | sha256:add0ea390e5a4009dca5e91a1b1ce1f14dc1a3cc072e8994c196c3e9ea4ae53b | HIGH | Credible witness |
| Not a Newton loyalist | FBI 302 (2023-06-02) | sha256:5f6fb58e4dc012c256ce3867b2fe2e24d1097b8a122154cd0d6c0d2524142c5d | HIGH | No bias toward defendant |
| IEC had no written policy | FBI 302 (2024-01-10) | sha256:2ba525d7f23e6be4070ce64ee533f98ad0087a336c0442bce78c01443765bfca | HIGH | No clear standard violated |

### Key Theme: Authorization Process Existed

**Evidence:**
1. Bathory Grand Jury testimony confirms dual approval requirement
2. Tracy Buck/Tyler Brown approved on President's side
3. Kathy Stapp approved on Secretary-Treasurer's side
4. Nitcher performed audit review before approval chain

**Defense Argument:** The expenses at issue went through IBB's established authorization process. Creeden's expenses were reviewed by the auditing department, approved by the President's side, and signed off by the Secretary-Treasurer's side. This multi-layer approval negates any criminal intent.

### Key Theme: No Written Policy for IEC

**Evidence:**
> "However, the International Executive Council (IEC; comprised of IP, IST, IVPs) had no written policy, but were held to the IBB Constitution and Labor Standards/Rules for expenditure of IBB funds."

**Defense Argument:** Without a written expense policy, Creeden cannot be said to have violated clear guidelines. The absence of specific rules means any subjective interpretation of "appropriate" expenses is insufficient for criminal liability.

### Key Theme: Good-Faith Reliance

**Evidence:**
> "NITCHER assumed all expenses made by JONES, BILL, and IVPs were for the benefit of the union."

**Defense Argument:** If the internal auditor herself assumed these expenses were legitimate, how can the defendant be held criminally liable for the same assumption?

### Key Theme: Character & Credibility

**Evidence:**
> "CAIN describes Carolyn Nitcher (NITCHER) as 'good as gold.'"

**Defense Use:** Nitcher has no axe to grind. She was not fired; she retired. She expressed discontent with Newton Jones. She has impeccable credentials (Masters in Accounting, 17 years of service). Her testimony will be credible to a jury.

## BAD for Defense (Potential Risks)

| Finding | Source | Provenance | Confidence | Mitigation Strategy |
|---------|--------|------------|------------|---------------------|
| "Scared daily" to question expenses | FBI 302 (2024-01-10) | sha256:2ba525d7f23e6be4070ce64ee533f98ad0087a336c0442bce78c01443765bfca | HIGH | Frame as organizational dysfunction, not Creeden's fault |

| Used for retaliatory audits | FBI 302 (2024-01-10) | sha256:2ba525d7f23e6be4070ce64ee533f98ad0087a336c0442bce78c01443765bfca | HIGH | JONES directed these, not Creeden |

| Believed STAPP "omitted expenses from reports" | FBI 302 (2023-06-02) | sha256:5f6fb58e4dc012c256ce3867b2fe2e24d1097b8a122154cd0d6c0d2524142c5d | MEDIUM | STAPP is a cooperator; redirect blame |

### Risk: Fear Culture Testimony

**The Problem:**
Nitcher's testimony about being "scared daily" is a double-edged sword. It can be used by:
- **Defense:** To show organizational dysfunction that negates individual intent
- **Prosecution:** To show leadership knowingly created culture of intimidation to avoid scrutiny

**Mitigation:**
Focus on the fact that Newton Jones was the source of fear, not William Creeden. Nitcher reported to Jones, not Creeden. The fear culture existed on the President's side, and Creeden operated under the Secretary-Treasurer's side.

### Risk: "Stay Out and Shut Up" Statement

**Context:** This statement was made when Nitcher questioned Tyler Brown's expenses (double hotel booking, Dominican Republic phone calls). BILL told her to "stay out and shut up."

**Mitigation:**
1. The expenses in question were Tyler Brown's, not directly Creeden's personal expenses
2. Creeden was defending an employee (Brown) - a management prerogative
3. The statement shows Creeden believed the expenses were legitimate

### Risk: Retaliatory Audit Use

**The Problem:**
Jones used Nitcher as a tool for retaliation against local lodges that opposed him. This paints IBB leadership negatively.

**Mitigation:**
All five documented retaliatory audits were directed by Newton Jones, not William Creeden:
- Seattle #104 (Opland ran against Jones)
- Minneapolis local (Voight questioned leadership)
- Edmonton Local #146 (Frailey potential opponent)
- Newfoundland local (trusteeship)
- Baltimore local (opposed MORE fund)

## Defense Witness Preparation Recommendations

### 1. Pre-Trial Interview
- Confirm all statements in FBI 302s
- Review Grand Jury testimony for consistency
- Identify any statements that may be used against defendant

### 2. Topics to Emphasize on Direct Examination
- Her qualifications (Masters in Accounting, 17 years experience)
- The dual approval process that existed
- Her assumption that IEC expenses were legitimate
- The absence of written expense policy for IEC members
- Her independence from Newton Jones (expressed discontent)

### 3. Topics to Minimize or Avoid
- Detailed questioning about "fear culture" (let prosecution raise it first)
- Specific dollar amounts of expenses she processed
- Her belief that STAPP may have omitted expenses
- Details of retaliatory audits (focus on Jones directing these)

### 4. Anticipated Cross-Examination Topics
- "Scared daily" statement
- "Stay out and shut up" statement from Bill
- Her admission that she never questioned Jones' expenses
- Her knowledge of nepotism and relocation expense abuse

### 5. Redirect Preparation
- Clarify that fear was directed at Jones, not Creeden
- Emphasize she was never fired for questioning expenses
- Note that she retired normally after 17 years
- Her positive reputation ("good as gold")

## Conclusion

Carolyn Nitcher is an **ESSENTIAL DEFENSE WITNESS** whose testimony can establish:

1. **Authorization existed** - Dual approval system documented
2. **Good-faith reliance** - Even the auditor assumed expenses were legitimate
3. **No written policy violated** - IEC had no specific expense guidelines
4. **Fear culture was Jones' doing** - Creeden was on Secretary-Treasurer side
5. **Credible witness** - "Good as gold" reputation, not a Jones loyalist

**Recommendation:** Call Carolyn Nitcher as a defense witness to establish the legitimacy of the expense approval process and to demonstrate that William Creeden operated within IBB's established (if informal) authorization framework.
