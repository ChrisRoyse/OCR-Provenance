## Timeline Gaps Identified

| Gap Period | What Should Exist | Why It Matters |
|------------|-------------------|----------------|
| **2016: Bank Salary Resolution** | Full convention resolution text on BOL salary prohibition | Key evidence that Jones and Creeden violated their own resolution by continuing to receive BOL salaries. Documents reference 2016 convention passed resolution but only summary exists. |
| **2016-2022: Pre-Investigation Period** | Internal audit reports, expense reports from Jones/Creeden | Six years of financial activity leading to investigation; only policies exist, no actual expense documentation in database. |
| **2022-09-20 to 2023-03-25** | Investigation triggering documents | Six month gap between Blake & Uhlig Memo and Whistleblower Letter - what prompted FBI/DOL investigation to begin? |
| **Newton Jones statements** | Any interview/proffer/statement from Newton Jones | Primary target has NO statement in database. All evidence is from cooperating witnesses. |
| **Kateryna "Kate" Jones statements** | Any interview/proffer/statement from Kate Jones | Alleged no-show employee with $100K+ backpay - received target letter 2024-01-26 but no statement exists. |
| **Cullen Jones statements** | Any interview/proffer/statement from Cullen Jones | Son of Newton Jones, alleged $160K/year for no work - target letter served, no statement. |
| **Shae Jones statements** | Any interview/proffer/statement from Shae Jones | Daughter of Newton Jones, graphic designer allegedly paid $113K - target letter served, no statement. |
| **Derek Zurowski statements** | Any interview/proffer/statement from Derek Zurowski | IT, Shae's husband, allegedly $145K-$250K - target letter served, no statement. |
| **Donna Jones statements** | Any interview/proffer/statement from Donna Jones | Sister of Newton Jones, relocated at IBB expense - target letter served 2024-04-01, no statement. |
| **Ryan Creeden statements** | Any interview/proffer/statement from Ryan Creeden | Son of Bill Creeden, alleged $180K for no work, sexual misconduct allegations - NO STATEMENT. |
| **Kyle Creeden statements** | Any interview/proffer/statement from Kyle Creeden | Nephew of Bill Creeden, architect allegedly paid for useless work - NO STATEMENT. |
| **James O'Leary statements** | Interview or statement from James O'Leary | AFL-CIO hire at $160K as "special assistant for international affairs" - mentioned but not interviewed. |
| **Warren Fairley statements** | Detailed interview/proffer from Warren Fairley | Fairley indicted with Creeden, McManamon, Stapp - no proffer or detailed interview in database. |
| **William Creeden statements** | Any interview/proffer/statement from Bill Creeden | IST and co-defendant - NO STATEMENT in database. |
| **2015-2023 Ukraine Travel Records** | Actual expense reports, receipts, itineraries | Jones Ukraine travel is central allegation - no actual financial documents, only witness statements about them. |
| **2015-2023 Italy Travel Records** | Expense documentation for 7+ Italy trips | Multiple witnesses describe lavish Italy trips - no actual expense documentation in database. |
| **2023-06-02 to 2024-01-10: Nitcher FBI 302 #2** | Potential additional Nitcher interviews | Gap between first Nitcher interview and second one - was she re-interviewed about new information? |
| **McManamon detailed proffer** | Comprehensive McManamon proffer document | McManamon indicted but only brief interview notes exist - no formal proffer like Brown/Baca/Stapp. |
| **Defense expert reports** | Any defense expert analysis | No defense materials appear in discovery - standard in criminal cases. |
| **Defendant proffers** | Proffers from Creeden, Fairley, McManamon (post-indictment) | Only Stapp plea exists from indicted defendants - others must have engaged in some negotiation. |
| **Bank of Labor records** | BOL board minutes, salary records, loan documents | MORE fund $7M loan to BOL mentioned repeatedly - no actual bank records in database. |
| **ADP/Payroll records** | Actual payroll data, vacation accrual records | Witnesses describe Bamboo system, ADP reports - no actual payroll data in database. |
| **2024-05-30 to 2024-08-30** | Activity between Brown plea and group indictment | Three month gap - what precipitated the August indictment? |

## Missing Documents

### Critical Missing Documents

1. **Defendant Statements/Proffers:**
   - Newton Jones - NO statement (primary defendant)
   - William Creeden - NO statement (co-defendant)
   - Warren Fairley - NO detailed proffer (co-defendant)
   - Lawrence McManamon - Only brief interview, no formal proffer (co-defendant)

2. **Jones Family Members:**
   - Kateryna "Kate" Jones - Target letter only
   - Cullen Jones - Target letter only
   - Shae Jones - Target letter only
   - Donna Jones - Target letter only

3. **Creeden Family Members:**
   - Ryan Creeden - NOT EVEN a target letter in database
   - Kyle Creeden - NOT EVEN a target letter in database

4. **Financial Records:**
   - Actual expense reports (only policies, no actual reports)
   - Credit card statements (only Simmons statement from 2023)
   - Bank of Labor board minutes
   - MORE fund transaction records
   - Payroll/ADP records
   - Vacation accrual records from Bamboo system

5. **Grand Jury Transcripts:**
   - Unknown witnesses - numbering in transcripts suggests more witnesses than appear in database

### Partial Documents Found

1. **Stapp GJX 27 Affidavit** - Exists but not "GJX 27" document per se
2. **Blake & Uhlig Memo (2022-09-20)** - Exists as "GJX 5"
3. **Nitcher FBI 302s** - Two versions exist (June 2023, January 2024)

---

## Chronological Anomalies

### Conflicting Dates/Information

1. **Nitcher Retirement Date:** Ashley Bathory testimony says "February '22" but James Cain 302 says "February 2023" - one year discrepancy.

2. **Kate Jones Employment Start:** Witnesses give varying dates between 2011-2013 for when Kate was hired.

3. **Marco Island Conference Date:** James Cain 302 says "February 26, 2023" but describes "2021 CSO conference" - appears to be date error (conference was 2021, interview was later).

4. **Bill Creeden Resignation:** Stapp Plea Agreement says "on or about August 2023" Bill resigned, but other documents suggest he was indicted while still employed.

5. **Kyle Creeden Termination:** Tyler Brown says Presley "got permission from JONES to fire KYLE" around 2008, but then says Kyle "might have been hired back" for MCI building project - inconsistent timeline.

### Timeline Contradictions

1. **Foreign Travel Authority:** 2008 IEC Resolution authorizes BOL employment, but 2016 Convention allegedly prohibited such salaries - documents exist for authorization but not prohibition.

2. **Vacation Policy Application:** Multiple witnesses describe officers NOT taking vacation time, but vacation policy (GJX 28) explicitly includes officers.

3. **Expense Review Process:** Witnesses describe expenses being on IEC agenda but never reviewed - suggests systemic failure but no IEC meeting minutes exist to verify.

---

## Investigative Recommendations

Based on timeline gaps, the following should be obtained/requested:

1. **Grand Jury Materials:**
   - All grand jury transcripts (appears incomplete)
   - Grand jury exhibits list (GJX series appears incomplete)

2. **Defendant Cooperation:**
   - Any proffers or cooperation agreements from Creeden, Fairley, McManamon
   - Post-arrest statements

3. **Financial Records:**
   - Actual expense reports submitted by Jones, Creeden, and IVPs
   - Bank of Labor records
   - MORE fund account statements
   - Credit card statements beyond Simmons

4. **Family Member Records:**
   - Employment files for all Jones/Creeden family members
   - Work product or activity reports
   - Relocation expense documentation

5. **IEC Meeting Records:**
   - IEC meeting minutes (none in database)
   - Agendas
   - Attendance records

---

## Summary of Blind Spots

The database reveals significant **information asymmetry**:

**KNOWN/DOCUMENTED:**
- Cooperating witnesses extensively interviewed
- Victim employees' perspectives
- Policy documents
- Some court filings

**UNKNOWN/UNDOCUMENTED:**
- Defendant perspectives (no statements from primary defendants)
- Family member involvement details
- Actual financial records underlying allegations
- Defense materials
- IEC meeting minutes that could show oversight failure

This represents a classic **prosecution file** structure - focused on proving charges rather than complete factual record. Defense materials and defendant perspectives are notably absent, which is significant for expert witness analysis.
