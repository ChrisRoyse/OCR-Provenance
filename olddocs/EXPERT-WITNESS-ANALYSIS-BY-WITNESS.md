### Defense Strategy for Newman

1. **Daubert/Rule 702 Motion**: File motion to exclude Newman's testimony as expert opinion
2. **Cross-Examination Focus**: "You are not a CPA? Not a CFE? You told the grand jury 'I'm not an expert,' correct?"
3. **Methodology Attack**: ScanWriter is automated data extraction, not forensic analysis
4. **Standards Attack**: "No rules exist for International Officers - on what standard do you base your suspicion?"

### Defense Strategy for Brown

1. **Attack Motive**: "You're facing 20 years but got a 60-month cap for testifying, correct?"
2. **Personal Benefit**: "You personally received vacation payouts, correct? Your bar exam was paid?"
3. **Contradiction**: Claims Fairley was "moral compass" but continued participating for years after Fairley's retirement
4. **Self-Interest**: "If you deny or contradict yourself, you lose your deal?"

### CRITICAL: PRIOR INCONSISTENT STATEMENT

| Date | Document | Statement |
|------|----------|-----------|
| **2023-08-05** | GJX 27 Affidavit | "After **confirming their unused Vacation balances**, I concluded that Kateryna Jones was entitled to $111,057.62; Newton Jones was entitled to $107,733.52; and William Creedon was entitled to $484,800.74" |
| **2024-12-19** | Plea Agreement | "STAPP approved and executed cash payouts for unused vacation time...where **STAPP knew the recipients had already used that vacation time**" |

**Analysis:** These statements are **mutually exclusive**. One cannot both "confirm unused balances" AND "know the recipients had already used" the time. This is textbook impeachment under FRE 613.

---

### Defense Strategy for Stapp

1. **Impeach with Prior Statement**: "Ms. Stapp, in August 2023 you said you 'confirmed unused balances.' In December 2024 you said you 'knew they had already used the time.' Which is true?"
2. **Perjury Implication**: "Either your August 2023 affidavit was perjury, or your December 2024 plea contains false statements - which?"
3. **Timeline**: Affidavit was ONE MONTH after vacation payouts - fresh memory
4. **Motive**: "You signed the affidavit while protecting yourself from civil liability?"

## KEY DEFENSE ACTIONS BY WITNESS

### Immediate Motions

1. **Newman**: File Daubert/Rule 702 motion to exclude expert testimony
2. **Russ**: Motion to compel Rule 26 disclosure and work product

### Trial Cross-Examination Priorities

1. **Newman**: "You're not an expert, correct?" + ScanWriter methodology attack
2. **Stapp**: Prior inconsistent statement (GJX 27 vs Plea Agreement)
3. **Brown**: Motive to lie (20 years → 60 months)

### Defense Witness Call

1. **Nitcher**: Establish dual approval, no written policy, good faith assumptions
