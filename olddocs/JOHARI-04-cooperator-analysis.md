### Impeachment Material

**Contradictions:**
1. Claims he "never recalled putting in for vacation on extended trips" but "did receive vacation payouts from IBB during his tenure"
2. Says Fairley was "the only moral compass left" but Brown continued participating for years after Fairley's retirement in August 2022

**Bias/Motive to Lie:**
- Cooperation agreement requires continued manifestation of "acceptance of responsibility"
- Government can void agreement if Brown "denies or gives conflicting statements"
- Significant sentence reduction incentive (60-month cap vs. 20-year maximum)
- Barred from labor union employment for years per plea terms

## PRIOR INCONSISTENT STATEMENT (CRITICAL)

### Stapp's Contradictory Sworn Statements

| Date | Document | Statement | Source File |
|------|----------|-----------|-------------|
| 2023-08-05 | GJX 27 (Declaration/Affidavit) | "After **confirming their unused Vacation balances**, I concluded that Kateryna Jones was entitled to $111,057.62; Newton Jones was entitled to $107,733.52; and William Creedon was entitled to $484,800.74" - Executed under penalty of perjury | `./fullcase/Creeden_Witness_Folders 1/Stapp, Kathy/GJX 27 Stapp Affidavit.pdf` |
| 2024-12-19 | Plea Agreement (Factual Basis) | "STAPP approved and executed cash payouts for unused vacation time...where **STAPP knew the recipients had already used that vacation time**" | `./fullcase/Creeden_Witness_Folders 1/Stapp, Kathy/2024_12_19_Creeden_Stapp_Plea_Agreement.pdf` |

### Analysis of the Contradiction

**Statement 1 (August 5, 2023 - GJX 27 Affidavit):**
- Filed in support of IBB's Motion for Summary Judgment in civil case 23-2250
- Stapp states she was "confirming their unused Vacation balances"
- Implies legitimate verification process
- Sworn under penalty of perjury under U.S. laws

**Statement 2 (December 19, 2024 - Plea Agreement):**
- Factual basis agreed to by Stapp in criminal case
- States she "knew the recipients had already used that vacation time"
- Admits she "made those payments...despite knowing that Newton Jones, Kateryna Jones and Creeden were not entitled to vacation payouts"
- Also sworn statement in federal proceeding

**The Contradiction:**
- The GJX 27 affidavit suggests Stapp performed due diligence ("confirming their unused Vacation balances")
- The Plea Agreement admits she KNEW the recipients had already used the vacation time
- These statements are mutually exclusive - one cannot both "confirm unused balances" AND "know" the time was already used

---

## Cross-Examination Strategy for Stapp

### Opening Line of Attack

1. **Establish the civil case affidavit:**
   - "Ms. Stapp, you signed GJX 27 under penalty of perjury on August 5, 2023, correct?"
   - "You stated you were 'confirming their unused Vacation balances,' correct?"
   - "You understood that statement would be relied upon by the Court?"

2. **Introduce the plea agreement admission:**
   - "Now, in December 2024, you signed a plea agreement, correct?"
   - "In that plea agreement, you admitted you 'knew the recipients had already used that vacation time,' correct?"
   - "That's also a sworn statement, isn't it?"

3. **Force the contradiction:**
   - "Ms. Stapp, help the jury understand: How does one 'confirm unused balances' when one already KNOWS the vacation time was used?"
   - "Either you were lying to the civil court in 2023, or you're lying to this Court now - which is it?"

4. **Exploit the perjury implication:**
   - "You understand that making false statements under oath is a federal crime?"
   - "So either your August 2023 affidavit was perjury, or your December 2024 plea agreement contains false statements - which are you admitting to today?"

### Supporting Impeachment Points

- **Timeline exploitation:** The civil affidavit was filed ONE MONTH after the vacation payouts (July 2023 payouts, August 2023 affidavit)
- **Fresh recollection argument:** At the time of the affidavit, events were fresh in her mind
- **Later remorse vs. initial deception:** Her plea admission suggests she was initially covering up the fraud
- **Motive for August 2023 lie:** She was protecting herself and superiors from civil liability

## Blind Spots

### What's Missing About Tyler Brown

1. **Proffer recording details**: FBI 302 notes recording exists (item 1D13) - actual words spoken may differ from summary
2. **Specific personal benefit amounts**: Total compensation/benefits Brown received not fully quantified
3. **Text messages and emails**: References to communications not fully produced in available documents
4. **Pre-2013 conduct**: Limited information about Brown's activities before becoming ISO Director
5. **Relationship with Fairley**: Described as close but no direct communications in evidence
6. **Other potential co-conspirators**: Brown mentions others "known and unknown" in conspiracy

### What's Missing About Kathy Stapp

1. **Scott Toth statement**: Reference to 302 statement from Scott Toth about Stapp (`2023.8.21_Creeden_302_Statement_Scott Toth_re_Kathy Stapp`) - content not fully extracted
2. **Original proffer recording**: Only notes and summary available, not verbatim transcript
3. **Text messages to herself**: Stapp documented concerns via text/email - not produced
4. **Color-coded expense work product**: Referenced but not in evidence file
5. **Her specific compensation/benefits**: What benefits did Stapp personally receive?
6. **Full scope of approvals**: Total number of improper transactions she approved over her tenure
7. **Instructions from attorneys**: She mentions being directed by "IBB attorneys" regarding Kate's pay - who specifically?

### Unanswered Questions for Both Cooperators

1. What cooperation agreement incentives exist beyond the plea terms?
2. Have they been promised anything regarding civil liability?
3. What immunity, if any, extends to uncharged conduct?
4. Are there pending or threatened charges against family members that might influence testimony?
5. What is the government's assessment of their credibility?
6. Have they passed or failed any polygraph examinations?
7. What other witnesses can corroborate or contradict their testimony?

---

## Conclusion

Both Tyler Brown and Kathy Stapp provide significant insider testimony, but both carry substantial impeachment baggage. Brown's value lies in his operational knowledge and documentary access, while his participation in the conspiracy undermines his credibility. Stapp's prior inconsistent statement regarding the vacation payouts is particularly damaging and represents a significant impeachment opportunity.

The critical Stapp contradiction between "confirming unused balances" and "knowing recipients had already used the vacation time" is a textbook prior inconsistent statement that can be exploited on cross-examination to devastating effect. Defense counsel should obtain both GJX 27 and the Stapp Plea Agreement and prepare a side-by-side comparison for the jury.
