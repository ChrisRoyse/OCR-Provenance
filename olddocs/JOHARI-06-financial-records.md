## Recommendations for Further Investigation

### High Priority
1. **Obtain complete 17,000-page AMEX records** - Only samples currently in evidence
2. **Request Bank of Labor board minutes** - To verify undisclosed salary arrangements
3. **Subpoena Apple/Amazon purchase records** - Referenced but not clearly in database
4. **Verify vacation payout calculations** - Stapp admitted making improper payments

### Medium Priority
5. **Charles Jones Sr. administration records** - Unexplored predecessor period
6. **My Way Films contract analysis** - Duplicate services with Cullen Jones?
7. **Kate Jones work product audit** - Zero documented output for $1.6M
8. **James O'Leary services verification** - Ghost employee allegations

### Low Priority (Corroborative)
9. **Ukraine property title search** - Jones' second home
10. **Travel awards/points audit** - Personal use of union-earned rewards

## Conclusion

The financial record analysis reveals significant documentation of the prosecution's case, including:
- Wire transfers totaling $108,544.50 to Kate Jones for no documented work
- $1.6 million in combined salary/expenses to Kate Jones over ~8 years
- $20,852.32 in unauthorized Ukraine travel
- ~$40,000 in local NC restaurant charges
- Undisclosed Bank of Labor salaries ($498,000 + $442,000 in 2022)

**Key Blind Spot:** Only 36 of 17,000 AMEX record pages are in exhibits. The complete records may contain additional unauthorized expenditures or, conversely, documentation that expenses were legitimate union business.

**Defense Opportunity:** The vacation payout issue (370 days accumulated for Creeden) and BOL salary arrangements may have been authorized under policies not yet located in the database.
